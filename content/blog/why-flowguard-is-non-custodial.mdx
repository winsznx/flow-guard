# Why FlowGuard Is Non-Custodial (And Why That Matters)

## Introduction

When projects hear "treasury management," the first concern is usually custody.

Who controls the keys?
Who can override transactions?
What happens if the backend goes offline?

FlowGuard is designed so that:

- It does not hold your keys.
- It does not sign on your behalf.
- It cannot move funds.

Everything is enforced directly by covenant contracts on Bitcoin Cash.

## The Core Rule

**If a rule is not enforced on-chain, it is not considered a real rule.**

That means:

- Spending caps must be validated by the contract.
- Approval thresholds must be validated by the contract.
- Vesting calculations must be validated by the contract.
- Milestone releases must be validated by the contract.

The backend can help build transactions.

It cannot make them valid.

Only the blockchain can.

## How Transactions Actually Flow

Let's break down a real example.

### Example: Executing a Vault Proposal

1. A proposal is created inside a vault contract.
2. Required signers approve it.
3. A transaction is constructed referencing the contract UTXO.
4. Signers sign using their own wallets.
5. The transaction is broadcast to the network.

At validation time, the contract checks:

- Does the number of approvals meet the threshold?
- Is the payout within the spending cap?
- Is the vault in an unlocked cycle?
- Is the recipient allowed?

If any check fails, the transaction is invalid.

There is no fallback path.

## Wallet Signing Model

FlowGuard follows a simple separation:

### Backend
- Reads contract state
- Builds transaction templates
- Indexes blockchain data

### Wallet
- Signs transactions
- Authorizes fund movement

### Blockchain
- Enforces covenant rules

The backend never has signing authority.

Even if the backend were compromised, it could not spend treasury funds without valid signatures and valid contract conditions.

## Streams and State Enforcement

For vesting streams, FlowGuard uses NFT commitments via CashTokens.

Each stream tracks state in a 40-byte commitment:

- Status
- Flags
- Total released
- Time cursor
- Recipient hash

When a claim is attempted:

- The contract calculates how much is vested.
- The NFT commitment updates.
- Only the valid portion can be released.

If someone tries to claim more than vested, the contract rejects it.

No backend logic can change that outcome.

## What This Prevents

Non-custodial design prevents:

- Admin key abuse
- Silent overrides
- Database-level balance manipulation
- Hidden rule changes
- Off-chain governance shortcuts

If treasury policy changes, it must change through contract logic — not through server updates.

## Why This Matters for BCH

Bitcoin Cash enables:

- Low fees
- Fast settlement
- UTXO-based scripting

Covenants extend this further by allowing contracts to enforce spending conditions.

FlowGuard uses this capability to shift treasury enforcement from:

**"Please follow the rules."**

to

**"You physically cannot break the rules."**

That distinction is important for:

- Grant programs
- DAO-style organizations
- Contributor payroll
- Long-term ecosystem funding

As treasury size grows, enforcement matters more than trust.

## Failure Modes

A strong system must define what happens when something goes wrong.

- A signer disappears → threshold logic still applies.
- A backend server goes offline → funds remain in contract.
- A wallet UI fails → UTXOs remain valid on-chain.

Treasury logic is not dependent on uptime.

It is dependent on blockchain validation.

## What Non-Custodial Does Not Mean

Non-custodial does not mean "no structure."

It means structure exists at the protocol layer.

FlowGuard contracts still define:

- Who can approve
- When funds unlock
- How much can move
- What conditions must be met

The difference is that enforcement happens at consensus level.

## Closing

FlowGuard does not ask teams to trust a platform.

It encodes treasury rules into covenant contracts on Bitcoin Cash.

Wallet signs.
Blockchain verifies.
Rules are enforced.

In the next post, we'll go deeper into how a vault contract enforces spending caps and approval thresholds internally.

If you're managing treasury on BCH, understanding this separation is essential.
