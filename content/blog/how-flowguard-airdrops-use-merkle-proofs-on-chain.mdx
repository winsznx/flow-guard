# How FlowGuard Airdrops Use Merkle Proofs On-Chain

## Introduction

Airdrops are common in crypto ecosystems.

But most of them are handled manually:

- A list of addresses in a CSV
- A script that sends funds
- A spreadsheet tracking who claimed
- A backend preventing duplicates

This works — but it relies on trust.

FlowGuard handles airdrops differently.

On Bitcoin Cash, airdrops can be enforced by covenant contracts using Merkle proofs.

That means:

- Eligibility is verified on-chain.
- Double-claims are prevented on-chain.
- Distribution does not require manual execution.

## The Core Idea: Merkle Trees

A Merkle tree allows a large dataset (like thousands of recipients) to be represented by a single hash: the Merkle root.

Each leaf in the tree represents:

(address, amount)

When someone claims:

- They submit their address
- Their allocation
- A Merkle proof

The contract verifies:

- That the proof reconstructs the root
- That the address and amount match a valid leaf

If verification succeeds, the claim is valid.

## What Gets Stored On-Chain

When a FlowGuard airdrop is deployed:

The contract stores:

- The Merkle root
- The total campaign allocation
- Expiry rules (if applicable)

The Merkle root becomes the reference for eligibility.

The full CSV does not need to live on-chain.

## Preventing Double-Claims

Verification alone is not enough.

The contract must also ensure:

An address cannot claim twice.

FlowGuard tracks claim state inside contract logic (using NFT commitment patterns similar to streams).

When a claim succeeds:

- The contract marks that claim as completed
- Future claims from the same leaf fail

This prevents:

- Duplicate withdrawals
- Replay attempts
- Manual tracking errors

Double-claim prevention is enforced by consensus.

## Claim Flow Example

Let's walk through it.

Campaign creator uploads CSV:

- Address A → 1 BCH
- Address B → 0.5 BCH
- Address C → 2 BCH

A Merkle tree is generated.

The Merkle root is embedded in the contract.

The contract is funded with the total allocation.

Now:

Address B wants to claim.

They submit their proof.

The contract verifies the Merkle path.

It checks if B has already claimed.

If valid, 0.5 BCH is released.

No admin approves this.
No backend updates a spreadsheet.

The chain validates everything.

## Why This Matters for BCH Projects

Structured airdrops are useful for:

- Grant distributions
- Contributor rewards
- Retroactive funding
- Ecosystem incentives
- Token launches

Manual distribution does not scale well.

With covenant-based validation:

- The creator cannot selectively deny valid claimers.
- The recipient does not need to trust the distributor.
- The contract enforces the allocation exactly as defined.

## Trust Reduction

Traditional airdrops require trust in:

- Whoever runs the distribution script
- Whoever tracks the claims
- Whoever maintains the backend

FlowGuard removes those dependencies.

The contract enforces:

- Eligibility
- Allocation size
- Single-claim rule

If a claim violates the Merkle proof or state rules, it fails automatically.

## BCH-Specific Advantage

Because Bitcoin Cash supports covenant logic and native token primitives, airdrop contracts can:

- Hold BCH
- Hold fungible tokens
- Validate proof logic
- Enforce state transitions

This keeps distribution logic fully inside the UTXO model.

No external oracle required.

## What This Changes

Instead of:

"Trust us, we'll send it."

You get:

"Prove you're eligible, and the contract releases it."

The difference is subtle but important.

One is discretionary.

The other is deterministic and enforced.

## Closing

FlowGuard airdrops move distribution from:

Manual coordination
to
On-chain verification.

Eligibility is proven.
State is tracked.
Funds are released only when conditions are satisfied.

No spreadsheets.
No manual payout scripts.
No hidden approvals.

Next, we'll break down how FlowGuard handles milestone-based budget plans for structured grant funding.
